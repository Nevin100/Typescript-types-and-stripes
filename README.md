Welcome to the **ts-tornado-bootcamp** ‚Äî a wild ride through the land of Types and Scripts where I survived the storm üå©Ô∏è of:

- ‚ö° Annotations
- üì¶ Axios (yes, HTTP but make it typed)
- üßÆ Functions & Parameters
- üåÄ Generics that bend time & space
- üìã Interfaces that judge your structure
- üèõÔ∏è OOP (Object-Oriented Pain... I mean Programming)
- üß† Type Inference (TS just *knows*, spooky right?)
- üîç Type Narrowing (because vague types are so last season)

## üí° Why This Repo Exists

Because I needed to **finally understand** why TypeScript screams at me when I try to be lazy.

> And maybe, just maybe, I wanted to flex a bit.

## üß™ What's Inside

| Module | What's Cookin'? üç≥ |
|--------|--------------------|
| `/annotations` | Type your variables like a scholar |
| `/axios` | Talk to APIs like a pro, but with types |
| `/functions-params` | Learn how to argue with functions |
| `/generics` | Reusable stuff, but smarter |
| `/interface` | Contracts but less boring |
| `/oop` | Classes, constructors, and chaos |
| `/type-inference` | Let TS do the guessing (spoiler: it's good at it) |
| `/type-narrowing` | Tighten that type until it's squeaky clean |
| `/node_modules` | It's huge. It's ignored. It exists. |
